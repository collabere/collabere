          This Privacy Policy explains how Collabere collects, uses, discloses
          and protects your Personal Information, obtained explicitly through
          www.collabere.com website ("Site"), as well as other information
          collected automatically without direct submission by you. 'Personal
          Information' is information that enables anyone to contact you and
          your credit-card details. Your full name, address, IP address, e-mail
          address are other examples of Personal Information.

          course of using some services of the Collabere; for instance, while
          registering on the website and while making an online purchase.
        </p>

        <p>
          Collabere may use the information submitted by you to send you e-mails
          for administrative purposes. Collabere does not make these e-mail
          addresses available to any third party. Collabere DOES NOT trade or

        </p>

        <p>
          When you use the Site, Collabere's servers (which may be hosted by a
          third party service provider) may collect information indirectly and
          automatically about your activities on the Site; for instance by way
          of cookies. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a
          user's browser from a web server and is eventually stored on a user's
          computer hard drive. This anonymous information is maintained
          distinctly and is not linked to the Personal Information you submit to
          Collabere. The anonymous information will be used for Collabere's
          understanding of how the Site is used and for other statistical
          purposes, for system administration and to personalize your
          experience. Collabere may also collect information related to access

          Site, but it will never contain Personal Information. Collabere does
          not disclose Personal Information to third parties in the normal
          course of operations. However, in situations when Collabere is legally
          obligated to disclose information to the government or other third
          parties, Collabere will do so. Collabere implements standard measures
          to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception of
          Personal Information. However, no internet site can fully eliminate
          security risks.
        </p>

          personal information that you share with Collabere is transferred and
          shared with such third party payment gateway operator. The said
          operator may also have access to your online purchase history/details
          that you make from store.doboz.in. Extremely sensitive information
          like you credit-card details are transacted upon secure sites
